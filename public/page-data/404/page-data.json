Focusing initially in low level programming, I quickly had many experiences in web development through my first internships, both front-end, back-end and DevOps; I have, through these 5 years of study, worn several hats expanding my field of expertise. \n\nAt the end of my studies, I started to become a freelancer. I define myself as a: freelance web developer \"full stack\" (although I may feel a little more comfortable with the back-end over time). \n\nAt first I specialized on a stack around JavaScript because it's just as useful in front and backend development (even mobile): React.js, React-Native, Node.js, Typescript. Then, in the last few years, I became very interested in other languages in order to be able to answer more and more problems (Golang, Rust, for example). I have also worked as a DevOps in some of my missions, so I master Docker, Kubernetes, Firebase, GCP, Vercel and AWS very well.\n\nCommunication is for me a very important quality in this field, that's why I also tend to share my knowledge (through courses, articles or by attending many Meetup events).\n\nCurrent focus: React / TypeScript / DevOps","about.situation":"Currently in passive research.","resume.title":"My Resume","resume.workExperience.title":"Work Experience","resume.workExperience.Quadient.title":"Back End Developer","resume.workExperience.Quadient.company":"Quadient","resume.workExperience.Quadient.period":"2021 (October) - 2022 (June)","resume.workExperience.Quadient.description":"Quadient is a company specializing in logistics equipment and mail processing.","resume.workExperience.Quadient.role":"Role: Back End Developer.
